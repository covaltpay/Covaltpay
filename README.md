# CovaltPay

CovaltPay is a trust-first payment orchestration platform for coordinated payments between multiple parties.

It enables rule-based, milestone-driven payment flows where trust is enforced by structure — not relationships.

## Why CovaltPay exists

Most group payments assume trust.
CovaltPay is designed for scenarios where:
- Parties may not know each other
- Funds are material
- Failure or non-delivery is costly
- Accountability matters

Instead of “send and hope”, CovaltPay introduces enforceable rules.

## Core concepts

- **Pacts** – structured agreements defining roles, rules, and conditions
- **Milestones** – objective checkpoints that gate payment release
- **Escrow logic** – funds are controlled by rules, not individuals
- **Verification layers** – human, automated, or agent-assisted

---

## Intelligence & risk layer

CovaltPay is supported by internal intelligence agents:
- **Sonar** – detects emerging risk, regulation, and opportunity signals
- **Guard Dog** – flags fraud patterns, delivery risk, and rule breaches

These agents operate independently and can be deployed without CovaltPay.
